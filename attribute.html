       <p>Her Story.</p>
  <p class="p1">This woman was born on May 22,1995 in Binalonan, a town of Pangasinan, Philippines.Among the five children of my mother, she's the second eldest.</p>
       <p class="p2"> I remember between her 5th and 6th grade she used to fetch me from school.</p>
       <p class="p3"> During her highschool days she used to cook 3 packs of instant pancit canton and she will evenly divide it into 5. I even remember she used my elementary diploma's frame for her project. It indicated her dream; to graduate, earn, buy phones,a car and house, and go abroad.</p>
       <p class="4"> In her college, due to financial problems in our family, she needed to budget her allowance big-time. Her phone was just a keypad. One large fried bangus will last her for a week. She couldn't afford to buy original books for her studies so she had to photocopy each pages of a borrowed book.</p>
       <p class="5">During her summer class, I stayed with her in Baguio. She told me she doesn't have someone to talk to in her aparment; that she was already chit chatting with cockroaches. There I helped her review her notes and some research. I remember she also had this sticky notes on her wall saying "Para sa pamilya"(For my family). That summer, I celerated my 13th birthday with her, she cooked pancakes as my birthday cake and she treated me Jollihotdog and fries.</p>
       <p class="6">As a reward for her hardwork, my parents bought her an off-brand tablet, she loved it of course.  But one day, she told my mother that her blockmates are making fun of her for having cheap gadgets.My mom said "Tiis lang, galingan mo lang,sa susunod makakabili ka rin ng magandang phone"(Just be patient, be good, soon you'll be able to buy a high-end phone).</p>
        <p class="7">After a few years and so much hardwork, she passed her licensure exam. She has become a registered medtech. She got her first job in a government hospital and the first thing she did to her first ever salary was to donate to church and bought her own high-end phone.She told my mom,"naalala ko 'yun".(I remember it).</p>
      <p class="8">Currently, she's paying for my college. She already owns a car, motorcycle,bought a lot, and already working in US.
